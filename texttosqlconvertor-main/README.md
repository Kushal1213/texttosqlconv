# ðŸŒŸ TextToSQLConvertor: 

TextToSQLConvertor is a powerful and intuitive application that bridges the gap between natural language and SQL. It empowers usersâ€”whether SQL novices or seasoned analystsâ€”to generate, optimize, and execute SQL queries using natural language input, all powered by Google's Gemini Pro LLM and a sleek Streamlit-based interface.

## Features
### Intelligent Query Assistance
- Converts natural language questions into SQL queries.
- Offers suggestions and syntax help.
- Optimizes queries for better performance.

### Data Exploration and Insights
- Enables users to query databases conversationally.
- Reveals hidden trends, patterns, and summaries.
- Perfect for analysts and data scientists.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Streamlit (UI)
- Backend: Python, Google Gemini Pro API, SQLite3
- Database: sqlite3 with data.db for demonstration

## Project Flow
1. User inputs a question via the UI.
2. Input is sent to the backend via Google API Key.
3. Gemini Pro model processes the input and generates SQL.
4. SQL is executed on a SQLite3 database.
5. Results are displayed to the user on the UI.

## Project Structure
```

TextToSQLConvertor/
|
\|-app.py         # Main application file (streamlit UI + model interface)
\|-sql.py         # Script to create and populate the demo SQLite database
\|-.env           # Stores Google API key securely
\|-requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
\|-data.db        # SQLite demo database

```

## Prerequisites
You should be familiar with the following:
- Basics of Generative AI and NLP
- Streamlit web apps
- SQL and relational databases
- Google Gemini API
- Python and SQLite3

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the repository:
```

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/TextToSQLConvertor.git](https://github.com/your-username/TextToSQLConvertor.git)
cd TextToSQLConvertor

```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Configure Environment:
Create a `.env` file and add your Google API key:
```

GOOGLE\_API\_KEY=your\_api\_key\_here

```
Generate an API key from: [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 4. Initialize Database:
```

python sql.py

```

### 5. Launch the App:
```

streamlit run app.py

```

## How it Works
### Prompting Gemini Pro
The model is instructed using a carefully constructed prompt to convert English questions like:
- *"How many students are there?"*
- *"List all the students working at INFOSYS."*
```

SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM STUDENTS;
SELECT \* FROM STUDENTS WHERE COMPANY="INFOSYS";

```

### Functions
- `get_response(que, prompt)` - Interacts with Gemini to generate SQL
- `read_query(sql, db)` - Executes SQL on the database and returns the result
